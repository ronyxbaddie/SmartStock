## SmartStock – Inventory Management & Monitoring System

SmartStock is a Python-based inventory management application built using Streamlit and SQLite.  
It allows admins to add products, monitor stock levels, track expiry dates, and quickly identify low-stock or expired items through a clean and interactive dashboard.

This project focuses on clean architecture, separation of concerns, and real-world inventory use cases rather than just basic CRUD operations.
